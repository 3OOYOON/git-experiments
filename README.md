# git-experiments
Lab for Advanced Software Design class

Steps i took:
    1. cloned repo. i already have ubuntu on my computer so i only had to use the https to clone the repo using the command git clone.
    2. then i made a new file called "new_file.txt" using vim and saved it
    3. i then used git add "name of file" in this case new_file.txt
    4. i then tried to use git commit but it got mad at me because it could not authenticate user so i had to write git confing my email
    5. i then wrote a commit message for my commit
    6. after that i tried to commit again by typing in my username and password but it told me they dont support password authenitication so i had to make a passkey on github.com, speciffically the classic version. i made t he passkey expire june 30 2025 so i wouldnt have to make a passkey again in the middle of class
    7. i tried to commit again and it asked for user name and password. i typed in my username, and for pasword wrote in my passkey made on github that i also saved locally on my computer because it wont show you the passkey ever again
    8. lastly i used git push to push my changes to my repository and i was able to see the new file on the github website for my repository.
